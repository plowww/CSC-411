;    Assignment #2: Fibonacci Numbers
;    Due: 09/21/2017 at 11:55 PM
;    Goal: Create a working MicMac program.
;    This program calculates the Fibonacci sequence of numbers.
               ;    Given some value N, the program will compute the Nth Fibonacci number.
               ;    The number will appear at the last address after instructions.
	       ;    Some code was borrowed from Example #1 (summation from 1 - 10).
	       ;    The result is located at address 012.
	       ;	Creator: Kevin Gomes
;    NOTE: We assume the first fibo F(0) to be 1, so it should be 1,1,3,5,8...
;    There are other implementations where F(0) = 0, but it was not stated which to use
;    in the assignment.

;    May have to press "run" multiple times if N is 10 (by default it is)
PC 0					  ;    Start the program correctly.

000    0011    Main:   	LODD    N         ;    Get the number (the loop counter).

001    C00E            	JNEG    Stop      ;    If the number is < 0, there is not much we need to do.

002    500E    More:   	JZER    Stop      ;    If the number is 0, we are finished.

003    000F            	LODD    First     ;    Otherwise, make the result First + Second, then
004    2010            	ADDD    Second    ;        Update what first and second are.
005    1012        	STOD    Result	  ;    Store the result of First + Second into an address.

006    0010		LODD	Second    ;    Load the second number and 
007    100F		STOD	First     ;        store it into the first number.	 

008    0012		LODD	Result	  ;	Load the current Fibonacci number and
009    1010		STOD	Second	  ;	store it into the second number.

00A    0011            	LODD    N         ;    We need to reload the number
00B    3013            	SUBD    One       ;        in order to decrement it
00C    1011            	STOD    N         ;        and update it.

00D    6002            	JUMP    More      ;    We go for one more step.

00E    600E    Stop:   	JUMP    Stop      ;    Nothing more to do. Jumps in the same spot over and over.

00F    0000    First:    0                ;    First number used in computation (0).
010    0001    Second:   1		  ;    Second number used in computation (1).
011    000A    N:        5                ;    Data to work with (loop counter).
012    0000    Result:   0                ;    Fibonacci after computations (set at 0).
013    0001    One:	 1		  ;	  A constant that we can use (1).
